        <p>American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed,
            Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around
            1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.</p>
